## About:

[C++ Code](https://github.com/masterujjval/Infix-to-postfix)

### Infix Notation:

 In infix notation, operators are placed between their operands. This is the most common way mathematical expressions are written in standard mathematical notation. For example:
- Addition: 2 + 3
- Subtraction: 5 - 2
- Multiplication: 4 * 6
- Division: 8 / 2
  
Infix notation follows the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), where parentheses can be used to specify the desired order of evaluation.

### Postfix Notation (also known as Reverse Polish Notation, or RPN):
In postfix notation, operators are placed after their operands. To evaluate a postfix expression, you start from the left and move to the right, performing the operation when you encounter an operator after its operands. For example:
- Addition: 2 3 +
- Subtraction: 5 2 -
- Multiplication: 4 6 *
- Division: 8 2 /

### Miscellaneous 

The **stack** data structure is required to convert any infix notation to postfix notation, it stores the operators according to their associativity and pops accordingly to generate desired results.
